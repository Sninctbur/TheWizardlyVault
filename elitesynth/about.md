## Combine Elite Synth NPC

**About:**
A modified version of Angelfinn12's Combine Super Soldier SNPC, featuring an improved ranged attack with more dramatic effects, velocity tracking, and the ability for props to block the attack.

**Implementation progress:**
This addon was actually on the Workshop at one point. I took it down because it didn't feel up to my personal quality standards for my addons, and I didn't want to fix the many problems it had. A fellow user by the name of Dreadox has since reuploaded my modified version with even more improvements and both my and Angelfinn's endorsement.
