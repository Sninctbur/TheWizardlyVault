## TTT False Traitor Badge

**About:**
A TTT traitor weapon which changes a corpse's role to look like a Traitor. Detectives can see through the disguise, and will announce to the entire server that it's fake when they inspect the body.

**Implementation progress:**
Fully functional. Lacks UI feedback for the user and lacks a formal model. It currently uses a SWEP Construction Kit placeholder model. It also probably wouldn't work correctly in TTT2 or with other mods that add new roles.

**Why I stopped working on it:**
I did not want to go through the trouble of creating and exporting a unique model for the badge, and I was getting bored of TTT anyway.
