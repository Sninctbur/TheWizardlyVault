## Custom Player Faction

**About:**
A Sandbox player-NPC-relation addon, with an emphasis on intuitiveness. Allows players to join the Combine, Zombies or Antlions at will, becoming friendly to NPCs of the respective group and hostile to others.

**Implementation progress:**
Feature-complete and decently tested. Has probably broken a few times, but it's been so long that I don't remember for sure if it actually did. (2019 was five years ago ;-;)

**Why I stopped working on it:**
I never believed that it was well tested enough. There are plenty of "join the Combine" addons on the Workshop already, so I didn't think I would be filling a demand by releasing CPF.
