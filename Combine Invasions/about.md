## Combine Invasions

**About:**
A Sandbox addon that occasionally attacks your map by generating waves of air-dropped Combine mobs. It was inspired by Minecraft survival night-time, which breaks up the primarily sandbox gameplay by introducing a survival challenge the player must prepare for.

**Implementation progress:**
Half-baked and quite buggy. The dropships have a habit of deploying combine in strange places or into walls. Some convars and variables suggest different types of dropships that I never implemented. Around the time of abandonment, I was working on a way to track Combine NPC deaths before starting the invasion timer again, preventing invasion events from overlapping.

**Why I stopped working on it:**
Almost a new gamemode by itself, Combine Invasions was my most ambitious solo addon since Bio-Annihilation II. Also, I began to doubt that the timed experience would be enjoyable: most people play Sandbox to relax, so the timer might be more annoying than fun to the average player. I myself only used the cmbi_force command to use it as a glorified NPC spawner. So, by the time I started moving on to game development, I decided not to split my time between my new projects and this one.
