## VEO: Violent Effects Overhaul

**About:**
A cosmetic, server-side blood mod. Adds variable-size blood decals which scale with damage, decal-based blood pools, particle blood sprays from damaged limbs, and corpse blackening from fire.

**Implementation progress:**
Feature-complete; formerly in testing and polish. Fun fact: it even has a private Workshop page.

**Why I stopped working on it:**
Throughout development, I ran into sporadic crashes: the worst kind of bug imaginable. Despite the changelog at the bottom of the script saying I fixed "most" of them, I did not feel confident that it was in a stable enough state to ever see public release. The mod wasn't developed for naught, however: the blood pooling feature was eventually adapted to my successful Hemorrhage mod.
