## Enhanced Soundscape

**About:**
Changes universal sound reverb based on the estimated size of the area the player is in. Inspired by the Sound Physics mod for Minecraft.

**Implementation progress:**
In infancy. There is some functionality that kicks in for large spaces, but it doesn't sound very good. A major bug occurs with looping sounds, like a gunship's hum.

**Why I stopped working on it:**
This project was a mess from the start. It was more of an experiment with Source's DSP sound filter system, which ended up abusing it more than anything. The room volume calculation is already done significantly better by some weapon bases, namely Modern Warfare Base and the Urban Coalition series I worked on.
