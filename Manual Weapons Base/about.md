## Manual Weapons Base

**About:**
A gimmick weapon base which requires the user to manually operate the functions of a firearm through a radial menu. Designed to give the player a feeling of tactile control over their guns, and introduce an element of skill to reloading inspired by VR firearms.

**Implementation progress:**
In infancy. The base weapon exists, but does not work. The radial menu is partially functional by venue of holding R, but has no graphics and does not accomplish client-server communication to actually execute the necessary functions.

**Why I stopped working on it:**
I came up with this mod late into my modding career. Everything fell apart when I started on the radial menu. While this is not the first time radial menus have been made, I could not find the time to study an implementation.
