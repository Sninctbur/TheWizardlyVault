# Welcome to the Wizardly Vault

With the publicizing of this repository, I announce my formal retirement from solo Garry's Mod addon development.

In my six years of making addons, I've started many more interesting projects than I've finished. This repository is an archive for some of the most notable projects I expect to never release, such that the public may observe their spirit (or discern what goes on in my head). Included in each of these addon folders is a short write-up about the addon's original goal and why I shelved it.

## IMPORTANT: Licensing (re-use) information

All of the code I've written for these addons is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This means that under the condition that I receive credit for the code, I authorize you as a fellow developer to reuse, modify, and even publish all or part of these addons. So if you'd like to try your hand at finishing one of these projects, I'll permit it as long as you follow those terms.

## How to install these addons

If you've never installed addons outside of the Steam Workshop before, then this process might appear daunting. It's in fact very simple:

1. Navigate to your Garry's Mod directory. You can do this quickly by right-clicking Garry's Mod in your Steam client and selecting Manage > Browse local files.
2. Navigate to the garrysmod/addons folder.
3. Copy the addon you want to try from here into that folder.
